  - title: Toward Cross-Language and Cross-Media Image Retrieval
    coauthors: Ahmed Id Oumohmed, Max Mignotte, Jian-Yun Nie
    publication: CLEF'04 (Cross-Language Evaluation Forum)

    description: >
      This report describes the approach used in our participation of ImageCLEF. Our focus is on image retrieval using 
      text, i.e. Cross-Media IR. To do this, we first determine the strong relationships between keywords and types of 
      visual features. Then the subset of images retrieved by text retrieval is used as examples to match other images 
      according to the most important types of features of the query words.

    coauthors: Philippe Langlais, Jian-Yun Nie

    description: >
      Une approche classique en recherche dâ€™information (RI) consiste Ã  bÃ¢tir une reprÃ©sentation des documents et des 
      requÃªtes basÃ©e sur les mots simples les constituant. Lâ€™utilisation de modÃ¨les bigrammes a Ã©tÃ© Ã©tudiÃ©e, mais les 
      contraintes sur lâ€™ordre et lâ€™adjacence des mots dans ces travaux ne sont pas toujours justifiÃ©es pour la 
      recherche dâ€™information. Nous proposons une nouvelle approche basÃ©e sur les modÃ¨les de langue qui incorporent des 
      affinitÃ©s lexicales (ALs), câ€™est Ã  dire des paires non ordonnÃ©es de mots qui se trouvent proches dans un texte. 
      Nous dÃ©crivons ce modÃ¨le et le comparons aux plus traditionnels modÃ¨les unigrammes et bigrammes ainsi quâ€™au 
      modÃ¨le vectoriel.
