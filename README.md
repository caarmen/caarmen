### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer currently focused on mainly on Python for backend projects professionally, and for random personal projects.

Previously I developed mobile apps (mostly Android). You'll find a few repositories here for Android and iOS apps.

I've also dabbled in front end (vanilla Javascript for now).

There are some other more obscure little projects here as well, in QBasic and Prolog for example.
