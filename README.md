### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer currently focused on mainly on Python for backend projects professionally, and for random personal projects.

Previously I developed mobile apps (mostly Android). You'll find a few repositories here for Android and iOS apps.
I've also dabbled in front end (vanilla Javascript for now).

Here are some repository highlights:
  - Poet Assistant (tool with rhymer/thesaurus/dictionary, for writing poems):
    - Android app: [poet-assistant](https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant)
    - iOS app: [poet-assistant-ios](https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant-ios)
    - Website/Electron app: [poet-assistant-web](https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant-web)
    - Qt Desktop app: [poet-assistant-desktop)(https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant-desktop)
    - REST api in Spring boot: [poet-assistant-server](https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant-server)
  - French revolutionary calendar:
    - Android widget: [FRCAndroidWidget](https://github.com/caarmen/FRCAndroidWidget)
    - Kotlin library: [french-revolutionary-calendar](https://github.com/caarmen/french-revolutionary-calendar) 
    - Android wear complications app: [FRCComplication](https://github.com/caarmen/FRCComplication)
    - ICS calendar generator: [french-revolutionary-calendar-generator](https://github.com/caarmen/french-revolutionary-calendar-generator)
  - Sunrise/Sunset java library: [SunriseSunset](https://github.com/caarmen/SunriseSunset)
  - Nounours (simple teddy bear that reacts to clicks and "moves" around semi-randomly):
    - Android app: [nounours-android](https://github.com/caarmen/nounours-android)
    - iOS app: [nounours-ios](https://github.com/caarmen/nounours-ios)
    - X11 app (including screensaver): [nounours](https://github.com/caarmen/nounours)


There are some other more obscure little projects here as well, in QBasic and Prolog for example.
