### Hi there üëã

#### TLDR
I'm a software developer currently focused on mainly on Python and Node.js for backend projects professionally, and Python for random personal projects.

#### What you'll find here
Previously I developed mobile apps (mostly Android). You'll find a few repositories here for Android and iOS apps.

I've also dabbled in front end (vanilla Javascript for now).
